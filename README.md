These are 3 seperate projects completed during my 3rd year at University.

To launch the Javascript & HTML website correctly, launch the document named 'Final'
Please note that a lot of textures fail to render correctly in Chrome, I recommend launching the project in Firefox.

To launch the Final-Lua product, launch the 'Main.Lua' file in suitable software such as Corona.

To launch the AI Coursework, use the 'Image-Classifier' file.
